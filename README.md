Here is a link to the chatgpt messages: https://chat.openai.com/share/48fbbc1c-5268-4281-b7dd-ef210d8517b7 (if the link doesn't work, lmk and I can just upload photos)
So, I thought for my website I would try to make chatgpt do something somewhat difficult... make tetris!! Honestly, It didn't turn out the best. The first files that chatgpt gave me were pretty good; it had a proper game board,
all the right pieces, and somewhat ok logic. BUT a very crucial aspect of tetris that chatgpt forgot to add was turning a piece. In the second message, I told it it wasn't working, and the solution it gave me wasn't 100% accurate.
It did turn the pieces, but it also removed / changed all of the tetrominos when it turned.
Overall, I think chatgpt is a great tool, but it lacks a lot when it comes to coding big projects by itself. It unfortunately just doesn't have the same logic that a human has. However, if I were coding this project from scratch,
it would have been a lot more difficult to get everything implemented.
